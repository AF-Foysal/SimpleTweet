# Project 2 - *SimpleTweet*

**SimpleTweet** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
- [x]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  - [x] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  - [ ] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
- [x] User can refresh tweets timeline by pulling down to refresh

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination
- [ ] Improve the user interface and theme the app to feel "twitter branded"
- [ ] Links in tweets are clickable and will launch the web browser
- [ ] User can tap a tweet to display a "detailed" view of that tweet
- [ ] User can see embedded image media within the tweet detail view
- [ ] User can watch embedded video within the tweet
- [ ] User can open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets
- [ ] On the Twitter timeline, leverage the CoordinatorLayout to apply scrolling behavior that hides / shows the toolbar.

## Notes

The main challenge was properly formatting the tweets so that each element contained in the tweet did not overlap. Other challenges that were faced were mainly issues with the dependencies not being up-to-date to the point that it conflicted with the running of the app. Another challenge was the addition of a timestamp.
Due to the time constraint, it was no completed in time. However, it will be completed by Part 2 of this project.
